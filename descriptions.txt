agouti-brazilnut.R
	- Runs the simulation. Nothing more, nothing less.


agouti-sensitivity-analysis.R
	- Contains routines that do a lot of things... (too many things, in fact)
	- Most of this code was used to gain intuition and was not used for any final outputs and/or graphics. 

	The Subroutines (in order starting at line 194):

	- eigvals_vs_survival
		- Plots Eigenvalues on y-axis and Adult survival on x-axis
	- sensitivity_matrix
		- Calculates Sensitivity and Elasticity matrices as well as stable-age distr.
	- sens_percent_harvest
		- Plots plant pop under different levels of GERMINATION/FECUNDITY.
		- Note: Only high harvest/hunting is used (no low harvest/hunt).
	- sens_surv_prob
		- Plots plant pop under different levels of ADULT SURVIVAL.
		- Note: Only high harvest/hunting is used (no low harvest/hunt).
	- sens_agouti_hunt
		- Plots plant and animal pops under different levels of HUNTING.
		- Note: Hunting is constant (not high and low)
		- THIS WAS USED FOR FINAL OUTPUT
	- sens_agouti_growth
		- Plots plant and animal pops under different levels of ANIMAL GROWTH RATE (rMax)
	- sens_agouti_capacity
		- Plots plant and animal pops under different levels of ANIMAL CARRYING CAPACITY
	- sens_init_pop
		- Plots plant and animal pops under different levels of INITAL POPULATIONS
	- sens_delta
		- Plots plant and animal pops under different levels of DELTA D
	- lambda_sim
		- Not useful... ignore this
		- Basicaly testing out some popbio functions
	- stoch_growth
		- Function that runs the simulation and calculates the stochastic growth rate of the plants.
		- maxt = length of time to run the simulation
		- All heatmap/countour code scripts contain some VARIATION of this funtion.
	- VertebratePVA
		- Testing out some more popbio code
		- Not really useful


heatMaps.R
	- Filed used by Eeman to test out heatmaps and contour plots.
	- This file was not used for any final output. All heatmaps/countour plots used in final output are in their own individual files/scripts.
	- This file contains code to generate a few heatmaps and contour plots.


sensitivityAnalysis.R
	- Contains more code to generate a few heatmaps/contour plots.
	- Multiple heatmaps are contained in this code.
	- This file was not used for any final output.


TestingConstHuntVsHiLoHunt.R
	- Testing whether constant hunting was the same or different from hi/lo hunting.
	- Does this by comparing stochastic growth rate of plants for both.
	- Concluded that they were the same.

ElasSampArbitraryMat.R
	- This was used for final output.
	- Takes our matrix parameter ranges and samples quasi-random matrices using latin hypercube sampling.
	- Calculates elasticity values for each element of each matrix
	- Averages these values for each element
	- Uses 3x3 matrix
	- Plots this with grouped bar plot


ElasSamplingAverage.R
	- Does elasticity sample averaging with the Brazil Nut matrix.

VarBased-Astrocaryum.R
	- Not working??? I don't remember
	- Attempts to do Sobol analysis with Astrocaryum

VarBased-EuterpeEdulis.R
	- Does Sobol analysis with Euterpe Edulis (cousin of acai palm)
	- Inconclusive results

VarBased-Random.R
	- Not working!! (Definitely not working)
	- Attempts to do Sobol over many random matrices.

VarBasedSensAnalysis.R
	- This was used for the final Sobol output
	- Performs Sobol on the Brazil Nut - agouti system.
	- Calculates Sobol indices for both plant and animal population being the model outputs.

VarBasedSensAnalysisAnimal.R
	- Not used for final output.
	- Performs Sobol on Brazil nut- agouti system with animal pop being output.
	- Made redundant by the file above.

DeltaVsAdultSurv.R
	- Plots contour map of deltaD vs. adult survival
	- Displays a weird pattern in high levels of delta and high levels of adult survival
	- Not used in final output, although the graph is interesting.

DeltaVsAvgHunting.R
	- Plots contour map of deltaD vs. adult survial
	- Not used in final output

RmaxRatioVsHiLoFreq.R
	- Not used in final output
	- varies the Markov chain probabilities.
