###========================================================================
### In this code block, I will be loading the required libraries (packages) for the analyses shown below.
###========================================================================

### Devtools: a package that contains tons of useful functions for creating and downloading R packages from GitHub directly
# install.packages("devtools") # only need to run install.packages once to install the package into your R library; delete the leading hash to run this command.
library('devtools')

### Digitize: a package that replicates external freeware such as WebPlotDigitizer
# devtools::install_github("tpoisot/digitize") # similarly, you only need to do this once
library(digitize)

### Tabulizer: a package that provides bindings for Java's tabula library for R
# install.packages("tabulizer")
library(tabulizer) # there are a LOT of infuriating issues with tabulizer installation, at least when I had tried.

#### Googledrive: a package that imports files from Google Drive folders, even Team Drives!
#install.packages("googledrive")
library(googledrive)
```

### Issues with installation

Installing `tabulizer` can be difficult due to underlying problems with `rJava` that can be frustratingly opaque and difficult to diagnose. Here are my notes for how I managed to get `rJava` and subsequently, `tabulizer` to install properly.

1. It looks like I can't get `tabulizer` to install because of [pointing issues](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer/issues/42) and/or version issues for the Java distribution that `rJava` is trying to point to.
    a. Needs to be Java 1.7 or 1.8 on up, but either on the `tabulizer` or `tabula` (`tabula` is the Java library that `tabulizer` imports into R) end, it seems like it gets rJava to default point to v 1.6.x if it is on the machine.
2. Open terminal and type the following:
    1. `MacBook-Pro-5:~ Char$ export JAVA_HOME=\x60/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8\x60`
    2. `MacBook-Pro-5:~ Char$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/server`
    3. `MacBook-Pro-5:~ Char$ env`
3. From the env command, you should now see:
    1. `PWD=/Users/Char`
    2. `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_151.jdk/Contents/Home`
    3. `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
3. In terminal call `open -a RStudio`
4. In Rstudio, call:
```{r, eval=F}
# install.packages(rJava)
library(rJava)
                .jinit()
                .jcall(“java/lang/System”, “S”, “getProperty”, “java.runtime.version”)
```

### Examples of using `tabulizer` and `digitize`

* [Digitize examples](https://github.com/tpoisot/digitize)
* [Tabulizer examples](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer)

## Importing an example figure

Below, we will use the `googledrive` package to import the file `Galetti1A.png` from our team drive. We will subsequently call `digitize` to extract information from the barchart.

```{r digitize-galetti, eval=F}
###===========================================================================
### Importing and downloading figure from Google Drive Team Folder
###===========================================================================
galetti1A_loc <- drive_get(id="10CXIOQAIIoC8Z9K_xjx97PwB63XEU-YR", team_drive = "CoharvestSRE") # Location of Galetti1A figure
galetti1A_fig <- drive_download(file=galetti1A_loc, path="~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/Galetti1A.png", overwrite=TRUE) # Downloading the figure to your local folder (note that you can skip these two steps and just directly point and click download instead or work from your local machine)

###===========================================================================
### Digitizing plot
###===========================================================================

galetti1A <- digitize::digitize(image_filename=galetti1A_fig$local_path) # Note that you could instead directly specify a local path and bypass the two steps above. Then it would be:
# galetti1A <- digitize::digitize(image_filename="~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/Galetti1A.png")

# save(galetti1A, file="~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/galetti1Adigitize.RData") # save the output to a serialized file

dev.copy(png,"~/Downloads/galetti1A-digitized.png", width=4, height=3, units="in", res=120, bg="transparent") # store the output to file; this is different from the usual routine because the digitizer package needs unencumbered access to the "Plots" tab in RStudio (not sure how it works in base R)
dev.off()
```

We can inspect the output by displaying it here:

![galetti1A](/Users/Char/Downloads/galetti1A-digitized.png)

```{r digitize-data}
###===========================================================================
### Extracting data
###===========================================================================
attach("~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/galetti1Adigitize.RData")
galetti1A # we don't care about the X values; these are just dummy values.

### 1: Pulling the y-column out
galetti1A_data <- galetti1A$y # we only care about the y-axis as this is a barplot with categories on the X

### 2: Pushing these values into a data.frame
galetti1A_df <- data.frame(Intact=galetti1A_data[c(TRUE,FALSE)],
                           Rodents=galetti1A_data[c(FALSE,TRUE)]-galetti1A_data[c(TRUE,FALSE)],
                           Insects=100-galetti1A_data[c(FALSE,TRUE)])
rownames(galetti1A_df) <- c("JI","Pi","Ca","PA","UN","XJ","SH","Af")

### 3: Displaying the table in a nice format (note that you need to run install.packages("htmlTable"))
htmlTable::htmlTable( round(galetti1A_df,1), # round to 1 decimal point, also see ?signif
                      rowlabel="Sites")
```

My guess from this type of data is what is ultimately useful is:

* What is dispersed (galetti1B; black cells)?
* The relationship between hunting pressure and/or rodent density and the percentage of seeds that are predated (`preyed upon by rodents` in Galetti's paper) versus dispersed (1B).

## Tabulizer example: Peres *et al.*, Brazil nut harvest

In **Table S1**, Carlos Peres and co-authors present information on the density and population structure of Brazil nut populations.

Steps:

* Import the PDF from the Google Drive Team folder
* Use tabulizer to import the table
* Perform cleaning to get the table into a usable format

```{r tabulizer-peres, eval=F}
###===========================================================================
### Importing table from PDF
###===========================================================================

peresPDF <- drive_find(pattern="Peres-BrazilNut-Science", team_drive="CoharvestSRE")
peresPDFurl <- drive_link(peresPDF)
# peresS1 <- tabulizer::extract_tables(file=peresPDFurl, pages=10) # uffda, sadly does not quite work. Will have to spend some time troubleshooting
peresS1 <- tabulizer::extract_tables(file="/Volumes/GoogleDrive/Team Drives/CoharvestSRE/Readings/Parameters/Peres-BrazilNut-Science.full.pdf", pages=10)
 
save(peresS1, file="~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/peresS1.RData")
```

```{r tabulizer-peres-cleaning}
attach("~/GoogleDrive/Rscripts/SRE_coharvest/peresS1.RData")
###===========================================================================
### Cleaning table
###===========================================================================
head(peresS1[[1]]) # wow it looks AWFUL!

peresS1list <- peresS1[[1]][7:38,]
peresS1list <- lapply(peresS1list, function(x) {unlist(strsplit(x," "))})

peres_entries <- unlist(lapply(peresS1list, length)) # the table import was wonky so it is incorrectly splitting along newlines
peres_rows <- which(peres_entries > 3)

peresS1df <- NULL # run a for loop below to extract data from the tabulizer object
for (i in 1:length(peres_rows)) {
  peresS1df <- rbind(peresS1df, tail(peresS1list[[peres_rows[i]]], 10))
}

peresS1df <- data.frame(peresS1df, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # convert output from matrix to data.frame format
names(peresS1df) <- c("Latitude","Longitude","AreaHectares","Density-treeHA-1","MeanDBH","pm","SE_DBH","CumS*","PercentJuve","NoTreeSampled")
peresS1df[c(3:5,7:10)] <- apply(peresS1df[c(3:5,7:10)], 2, as.numeric) # convert several columns to numeric class

peresS1df$HuntIntensity <- c("U","U","P","L","L","P","P","L","M","L","M",rep("U",2),rep("L",6),rep("M",2),"U","M") # argh, this column didn't import so we get to hand impute...lovely

###===========================================================================
### Displaying table
###===========================================================================
htmlTable::htmlTable(peresS1df, rnames=c("Pinkaiti","Kranure","Saraca","Maraba","Tapajos","Alto Cajar","Iratapuru","Aventura","Ussicanta","Lago Ciputuba","Amana","Rio Cristalino","Claudia","Nova Esperanca","Colocacao Tucuma","Colocacao Rio","Encontro","Oculto","Limon","El Tigre","El Sena","Alter do Chao","Rio Ouro Preto"), rowlabel="Sites")
```

In this case, what we likely care about is:

* Do they specify what "hunt intensity" means? Is it a measure of how many seeds were removed?
* Is there information on agouti density along with the hunt intensity and juvenile composition data?

To be honest, however, this data set is related but a bit orthogonal IMO to the type of data that we would need.
